## README: Predicting Bike Demand Using Multiple Linear Regression

### Overview
This project builds a predictive model for shared bike demand using multiple linear regression. The goal is to:
- Identify key factors influencing bike demand.
- Provide actionable insights for operational planning and marketing.
- Improve forecasting accuracy using advanced regression techniques.

### Key Features
1. **Data Exploration:** Insights into seasonality, weather impact, and usage patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Added polynomial features for continuous variables and addressed multicollinearity.
3. **Modeling:** Compared OLS, Ridge, and Lasso regressions with cross-validation to optimize performance.
4. **Performance Metrics:**
   - **Best Model:** Lasso Regression
     - RÂ² = 0.8655
     - RMSE = 706.39

### Data Overview
The dataset contains daily bike demand information spanning two years, with 16 columns and 730 rows. Predictor variables include:
   - Continuous: `temp` (normalized temperature), `atemp` (feels-like temperature), `hum` (humidity), and `windspeed`.
   - Categorical: `season` (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter), `weathersit` (weather condition), `holiday`, `workingday`, and `yr` (year).

### Visualizations
- **Scatter Plots:** Explore the relationship between temperature and bike demand.
- **Box Plots:** Show seasonal and weather-wise variations in demand.
- **Heatmaps:** Highlight correlations between key predictors and the target variable (`cnt`).

### Modeling
- **Approaches Tested:**
  - Ordinary Least Squares (OLS): Baseline model for comparison.
  - Ridge Regression: Regularization to handle multicollinearity.
  - Lasso Regression: Regularization and feature selection for optimal performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Cross-validation was used to select the best regularization parameters for Ridge and Lasso.

### Business Insights
1. **Seasonality:** Higher demand in summer and fall; lower in winter.

   - **Flexible Pricing:** Incentivize usage during unfavorable weather conditions.
2. **Operational Planning:** Optimize bike inventory and staffing during high-demand periods.
3. **Marketing Strategy:** Target promotions on clear-weather days and weekends to maximize casual ridership.

### Repository
